# bikesharing

### Purpose of Analysis
We are currently looking for other ways to convince investors that a bike-sharing program in Des Moines is a solid business proposal. We created new visualizations to show: 
1. Show the length of time that bikes are checked out for all riders and genders
2. Show the number of bike trips for all riders and genders for each hour of each day of the week
3. Show the number of bike trips for each type of user and gender for each day of the week.
