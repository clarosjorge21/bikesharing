# bikesharing

### Purpose of Analysis
We are currently looking for other ways to convince investors that a bike-sharing program in Des Moines is a solid business proposal. We created new visualizations to show: 
1. Show the length of time that bikes are checked out for all riders and genders
2. Show the number of bike trips for all riders and genders for each hour of each day of the week
3. Show the number of bike trips for each type of user and gender for each day of the week.

### Results

With our first visualization, you are able to see the top starting locations, the color and shape are affected by how popular the location is.

With our second visualization, you are able to see the average trip duration seperated by the birth year. Bikes have random popularities between the birth years.

Our third visualization, you can see the amount of time that is spent on bikes broken down by the hour. As you can see, around the first 20 minutes, the amount of time spent on the bike drops significantly.

Our fourth visualization, is similar to our third visualization as it shows the amount of time spent on bikes broken down by the hour but adds the filter of gender. As we can see, a large amount of the bike riders are males.

Our fifth visualization is a heat map showing the most popular stop times. The darker the color, the more amount of stop times for that time. Our most popular time is around 7am-9pm and 5pm to 7pm during the week.

Our sixth visualization is a heat map thats similar to our fifth one but breaks it down by gender. While the times don't change much you can see that the male audience has more of our rentals.

Our seventh visualization is a heat map that is broken down like the past two but we split it up to customer and subscriber. We can see that most of our clients come from our subscriber base.

### Summary
Overall, we gained a ton of information out of our research. We can see our most popular locations, our popular times along with who rents bikes out the most. I would suggest for future analysis we break down things a little more. The first visualization I would suggest is to break it down by usertype and location. We can see which locations are used more by our subscribers and focus on getting more bikes to this location. A second visualization would be to make one with trip duration and our bikeid, I suggest this to see which bikes are receiving more time on the road and would need more maintenance to other bikes.
